# T1rho
Matlab code for calculating and displaying MRI T1rho images.

Program uses two parameter linear and nonlinear least squares exponential fits of MRI data at different spin lock times to calculate T1rho values in ms.

The main program is T1rho_map2.m which uses the function file exp_fun1.m for calculating the exponential function and the Jacobian

See M-file header comments for more information.
